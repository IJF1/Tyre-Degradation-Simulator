# F1 Tyre Degradation Simulation – Analysis vs. Real Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates tyre degradation in Formula 1 using a physics-inspired model.  
The simulator tracks **grip, wear, temperature, pressure, and lap time** across multiple laps, allowing analysis of how tyre performance evolves in race conditions.  

To validate and benchmark the model, I compared the simulator’s lap time degradation curve against **Lewis Hamilton’s 2024 British Grand Prix (Silverstone) stint (laps 1–18, dry conditions).**

## ⚙️ Simulation Parameters
- **Tyre Compound:** Medium  
- **Stint Length:** 18 laps  
- **Aggression Factor:** 1.05  
- **Track Abrasion:** 1.3  

**Per-lap outputs:**
- Grip coefficient  
- Wear fraction  
- Tyre temperature (°C)  
- Tyre pressure (bar)  
- Lap time (s)

## 📊 Results

### 🔹 Simulator Lap Time Degradation
- Lap times increase progressively with tyre wear.  
- By lap 18, degradation adds ~15 seconds compared to lap 1.  
- The model shows continuous grip loss leading to a near-linear lap time increase.  

### 🔹 Real Lap Times (Hamilton, Silverstone 2024)
- Lap times remain relatively stable between **1:31–1:32** for most of the stint.  
- A sharp rise in lap time only appears around lap 17–18, consistent with tyres dropping off suddenly.  

---

## 🔎 Comparison & Insights
- **Simulator trend:** Lap times degrade steadily with wear → *linear profile*.  
- **Real data trend:** Lap times stay flat, then spike → *exponential “cliff” profile*.  
- **Key difference:** The model overestimates early degradation and underestimates the late sudden drop-off.  

**Implications:**
- Tyre wear should not linearly impact lap time.  
- A *threshold-based grip cliff* (critical wear point) should be added to the model.  
- Real degradation is strongly influenced by **thermal management** and **cumulative heat cycles**, not just wear.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement a **cliff model**: lap times stable until ~70–80% wear, then rapid degradation.  
- Add **track-specific calibration** (abrasion, corner load, weather).  
- Validate against **other 2024 race stints** for multiple compounds.  
- Extend model to include **pit stop strategy simulation**.
